# PokeReact
Build Simple Pokedex using API http://pokeapi.co

Using React and Webpack.

## Demo, clone this repo and then
````````````````
npm install
npm start
````````````````
The Demo will be served http://localhost:8080

## Problem
Change API endpoints from http://pokeapi.co/api/v2 to http://pokeapi.salestock.net:8000/api/v2. Because my countries (South East Asia) is not available to access this api when access the API always request captcha :(
